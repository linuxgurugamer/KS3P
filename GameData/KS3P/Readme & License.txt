How to install:
Directly inside the downloaded ZIP-file should be a folder named 'KS3P'. Drop this folder inside the GameData folder that is inside your KSP directory.

The mod contains:
- The KS3P plugin
- Platform-specific shader bundles (Thank you, Thomas P!)
- Example textures (from the Unity post-processing stack)
- Example configuration


License:
- The shaders and effects used in this pack were taken directly from the Unity Post-Processing asset, which can be found here:

- I (The White Guardian) only take credit for building a bridge across the gap between KSP and the Unity asset.
- Some of the bundled textures were kindly donated by KSP forums user Galileo and are included with his kind permission.
